\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The Atomic Swap protocol allows two parties to exchange their assets ``atomically'' without trusted third parties.
``Atomic'' means the swap either succeeds or fails for both parties at any given time.
In blockchains, Atomic Swap is usually implemented by using Hashed Timelocked Contracts (HTLCs)\MOD{~\cite{decker2015fast}}.
The HTLC is a type of transaction that, the payee should provide the preimage of a hash value before a specified deadline, otherwise the payment fails - the money goes back to the payer and the payee will not get any money.

% how important is Atomic Swap
The Atomic Swap has already been widely adopted in the cryptocurrency industry.
In particular, it realized the Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes), and started the era of Decentralized Finance (De-Fi).
In a DEX, traders publish and participate in deals, and the dealing process is regulated by a smart contract embedding the Atomic Swap protocol.
Different from centralized exchanges, DEXes are non-custodial - traders does not need to deposit their money in DEXes.
The non-custody property avoids DEXes from money thefts, which commonly happened on centralized exchanges.
To date, the DEX market volume has reached approximately 50,000 ETH~\footnote{\url{https://dex.watch/}.}.
More specifically,
there are more than 250 DEXes~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/distribuyed/index}.};
there are more than 30 DEX protocols~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/evbots/dex-protocols}.};
there are more than 4,000 active traders in all DEXes~\footnote{\url{https://dex.watch/}.}.

% research problem
However, \MOD{being atomic does not indicate the Atomic Swap is fair}.
In particular, in an Atomic Swap, the swap initiator can decide whether to proceed the swap, and the default maximum time for him to decide is 24 hours~\cite{nolan2013alt}.
Whether this fact influences the fairness of the Atomic Swap remains unknown.


\MOD{
% why problematic
Intuitively, in the Atomic Swap, the swap initiator can speculate without any penalties.
More specifically, the swap initiator can keep waiting before the timelock expires.
If the price of the swap participant's asset rises, the swap initiator will proceed the swap so that he will profit.
If the price of the swap participant's asset drops, the swap initiator can abort the swap, so that he won't lose any money.

% optionality
We observe that, this problem is equivalent to the Optionality in Finance, which has already been studied for decades.
In Finance, an investment is said to have Optionality if 1) settling this investment happens in the future rather than instantly; 2) settling this investment is optional rather than mandatory.
For an investment with Optionality, the option itself has value besides the underlying asset~\cite{higham2004introduction}, and the value is called the \textit{premium}.
The option buyer should pay for the premium besides the underlying asset, so that he can no longer speculate without penalties.

% initiator in atomic swap has optionality
In the Atomic Swap, the swap initiator has the Optionality, as he can choose whether to proceed or abort the swap.
Unfortunately, the Atomic Swap does not take the Optionality into account, and the swap initiator is not required to pay for the premium.

% atomic swap should not have optionality
However, the Atomic Swap is designed for currency exchange rather than options, and the currency exchange should not have Optionality.
Once agreed by both parties, the currency exchange is settled without any chance for both parties to regret.

% what we do briefly
In this paper, we investigate the unfairness of the Atomic Swap, and propose two fair Atomic Swap variants.
We start from formally modeling the Atomic Swap and the American Call Option in Finance,
then prove that an Atomic Swap is equivalent to a premium-free American Call Option based on our model.
Following this proof, we then evaluate how unfair the Atomic Swap is from two different perspectives: quantifying the unfairness and estimating the premium.
After that, we propose two fair Atomic Swap protocols with the premium mechanism, in which one is for currency exchange while the other is for American Call Options.
Both protocols can be implemented on existing blockchains, and we give reference implementations as well.
Blockchains with smart contracts (e.g. Ethereum) directly support our protocols, and blockchains with scripts only (e.g. Bitcoin) can support out protocols by adding a simple opcode.

\subsection{Our contributions}

Our contributions are as follows:

\paragraph{We formalize the Atomic Swap and the American Call Option, and prove that the Atomic Swap is equivalent to the premium-free American Call Option.}
We use formal languages to define the Atomic Swap and the American Call Option.
In particular, we describe them as protocols, and prove that the Atomic Swap is equivalent to the premium-free American Call Option:
The initiator and the participant in Atomic Swap are the option buyer and the option seller in American Call Options, respectively;
the initiator asset and the participant asset in Atomic Swap are the used currency and the underlying asset in American Call Options, respectively;
the participant asset's timelock in Atomic Swap is the strike time in American Call Options;
the current price of the participant asset in Atomic Swap is the strike price in American Call Options;
redeeming cryptocurrencies in Atomic Swap is exercising the contract in the American Call Options.

\paragraph{Based on our formalization, we prove that the Atomic Swap is unfair to the participant.}
We point out that, according to the option theory in Finance, the Atomic Swap - modelled as the premium-free American Call Option - is unfair to the participant, especially in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.
In practice, the initiator can decide whether to proceed the swap while investigating the cryptocurrency market.
However, proceeding or aborting the swap does not require the initiator to pay for the premium.
This leads to the scenario that, if the participant's asset price rises before the strike time, he will proceed the swap to profit, otherwise he will abort the swap to avoid losing money.
In this way, the initiator is risk-free towards the market.

\paragraph{We evaluate the Atomic Swap unfairness of cryptocurrencies, and compare it with that of conventional finance assets.}
We evaluate the unfairness of the Atomic Swaps for mainstream cryptocurrency pairs, and also make comparisons between cryptocurrencies and conventional finance assets - stocks and fiat currencies.
Our evaluation and comparison consist of two parts: 1) quantifying the profit and the mitigated risk of the initiator, 2) estimating how much the premium should be.
% first
First, we quantify the profit and the mitigated risk of the initiator based on historical exchange rate volatility.
Our results show that with the default strike time of 24 hours, the profit and the mitigated risks of our selected cryptocurrency pairs are approximately 1\%, while for stocks and fiat currencies the values are approximately 0.3\% and 0.15\%, respectively.
% second
Second, we use the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein option pricing model to estimate how much the premium should be for Atomic Swaps in cryptocurrencies.
In Finance, the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model is the conventional option pricing model for American-style options.
Our results show that, with the default strike time of 24 hours, for cryptocurrency pairs the premium should be approximately 2\%, while for stocks and fiat currencies the premium is negligible.
Also, the premium values rise for all items with the strike time increasing, then start to converge when the strike time reaches 300 days.

\paragraph{We propose two fair Atomic Swap protocols, one is for currency exchange and the other is for American Call Options.}
Based on our observation that the unfairness is introduced by the unpaid premium,
we then propose two fair Atomic Swap protocols, one is for currency exchange and the other is for American Call Options.
The two protocols achieve the fairness by implementing the premium mechanism upon the original protocol - The initiator should deposit the premium on the participant's blockchain when initiating the swap.
\MOD{
In the currency exchange-style protocol, the premium will go to the participant if the initiator misbehaves, otherwise it will go back to the initiator.
In the American Call Option-style protocol, the premium goes to the participant if the participant behaves well, otherwise it will go back to the initiator.
}

\paragraph{We describe how to implement our proposed protocols on existing blockchains.}
We give solutions to implement our protocols on existing blockchains, including blockchains supporting smart contracts and blockchains supporting scripts only.
For blockchains supporting smart contracts such as Ethereum, our protocols can be directly implemented.
For blockchains only supporting scripts such as Bitcoin, our protocols can be implemented by adding one more opcode.
We call the opcode ``OP\_LOOKUP\_OUTPUT'', and it looks up the owner of a specific output.
We use Solidity as an example of smart contracts, and the Bitcoin script code as an example of scripts.
