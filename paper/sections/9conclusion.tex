\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In this paper, we investigate the unfairness of the Atomic Swap.
We point out that an Atomic Swap is essentially a premium-free American Call Option,
and the Atomic Swap protocol is unfair to the participant.

% evaluate
We then evaluate the Atomic Swap unfairness, and compare the unfairness between mainstream cryptocurrencies and conventional financial assets.
Our evaluation consists of quantifying the unfairness and estimating the unpaid premium.
The evaluation results show that the Atomic Swap with cryptocurrencies is much more unfair than with stocks and fiat currencies in the same setting, because the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile.

% propose
Furthermore, we propose two fair Atomic Swap protocols, both implements the premium mechanism.
One of our proposed protocols is for currency exchange, and the other is for American Call Options.
We implement both protocols in Solidity as an example of blockchains with smart contracts such as Ethereum.
We also give instructions on how to implement our protocols by adding a single opcode to blockchains with scripts such as Bitcoin.
