\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In this paper, we investigate the fairness of Atomic Swap.
We show that an Atomic Swap is equivalent to a premium-free American Call Option, and Atomic Swap is unfair to the participant.

% quantify
We then evaluate the fairness of Atomic Swap protocol, and compare the fairness between mainstream cryptocurrencies and conventional financial assets.
Our evaluation consists of quantifying the fairness and estimating the unpaid premium.
The evaluation results show that the Atomic Swap with cryptocurrencies is much more unfair than with stocks and fiat currencies in the same setting, because the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile.

% propose
Furthermore, we propose an improvement on Atomic Swap, which implements the premium mechanism, to make it fair.
It supports both the currency exchange-style Atomic Swap, and the American Call Option-style Atomic Swap.
We implement our protocol in Solidity as an example of blockchains with smart contracts such as Ethereum.
We also give instructions on implementing our protocol using Bitcoin script, which requires adding a single opcode to the Bitcoin script.
