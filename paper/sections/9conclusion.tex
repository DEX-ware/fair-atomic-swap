\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}


We model the Atomic Swap protocol by using the American Call Option,
and observe that the Atomic Swap protocol is unfair to the participant.
In particular, we prove that the Atomic Swap protocol is equivalent to an American Call Option without the premium,
and the unpaid premium is the unfair part of the protocol.

We then evaluate the unfairness of the Atomic Swap protocols by analyzing the volatility and pricing the expected premium for mainstream cryptocurrency pairs.

% propose
Furthermore, we propose two fair Atomic Swap protocols, both of which extend the original protocol by implementing the premium mechanism.
One of our proposed protocols is for currency exchange, and the other is for American Call Options.
For both protocols, the initiator creates all contracts when setup, and deposits the premium on the participant's blockchain when initiating.
For the currency exchange-style protocol, the premium goes back to the initiator if the swap is successful, and otherwise goes to the participant.
For the American Call Option-style protocol, the premium goes to the participant once the participant's asset is redeemed or refunded.

Our future work is to formally verify the security of the Atomic Swap protocol,
then construct a provably secure and fair Atomic Swap protocol which does not require the initiator to hold some participant's asset.
