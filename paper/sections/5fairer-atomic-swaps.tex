\section{A Fair Atomic Cross-Chain Swap}
\label{sec:fair_atomic_swap}

We propose a solution to make the Atomic Cross-Chain Swap fair: 
The initiators should specify the percentages that he can refund before \textbf{initiating} an Atomic Swap.

In detail, an Atomic Cross-Chain Swap is defined as $\mathcal{AS} = (x_1, Coin_1, x_2, Coin_2, \alpha)$.
\textbf{Initiate} additionally takes a percentage $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ as inputs.
The contract script $\mathcal{C}_1$ is changed to ``Alice pays $x_1$ $Coin_1$ from $\beta_{A, 1}$ to $\beta_{B, 1}$ if Bob can provide $s$ before or on a timelock $\Delta_1$ (which is a timestamp). After $\Delta_1$, Alice can refund $\alpha$ of the money - get $\alpha$ $x_1$ $Coin_1$ back, and $(1 - \alpha)$ $x_1$ $Coin_1$ is sent to Bob.''

Bob can judge whether $\alpha$ is fair or not.
If Bob thinks $\alpha$ is fair, he will participate in $\mathcal{AS}$.
The worst case is that the price of $Coin_2$ moves down, Alice aborts $\mathcal{AS}$ by \textbf{refund}, and Bob still gets $\alpha x_1 Coin_1$.

This further marketizes the Atomic Cross-Chain Swaps.
We consider the following cases:

\paragraph{An initiator aiming at profitting}
The initiator will intend to choose a big $\alpha$, so that he can minimize the loss of \textbf{refund} once the price of $Coin_2$ drops.

\paragraph{An initiator aiming at exchanging his coin as soon as possible.}
The initiator will intend to choose a small $\alpha$, so that his contract will attract more participants.
