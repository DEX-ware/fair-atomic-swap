\paragraph{Atomic Swaps}
The Atomic Swap protocol was first proposed on the BitcoinTalk forum informally in 2013~\cite{nolan2013alt}.
Herlihy et al. first formalised the Atomic Swap protocol~\cite{herlihy2018atomic}.
Meyden et al. first formally analysed the Atomic Swap smart contracts~\cite{van2018specification}.
Several Atomic Swap variants were proposed for sidechains~\cite{robinson2019atomic} and solving conflicts due to concurrent operations~\cite{zakhary2019atomic}.

\paragraph{Optionality of Atomic Swaps}
The optionality of Atomic Swaps was first identified by an anonymous person entitled ZmnSCPxj in the Lightning-dev mail list in 2018~\cite{optionality-origin}.
Eizinger et al. first tried to address the optionality problem by implementing the premium mechanism in the Atomic Swap\cite{first-attempt-optionality}.
Liu et al. used the Atomic Swap to construct the option~\cite{liu2018atomic}, but paying for the premium requires an extra blockchain besides the two blockchains, and they do not justify its fairness.

\paragraph{Option Pricing}
The Black-Scholes model is the first model to price the European options~\cite{black1973pricing}.
The Cox-Ross-Rubinstein extended the Black-Scholes to price the American Options~\cite{cox1979option}.
