\section{Atomic Swap and American Call Option}
\label{sec:formalization}

In this section, we describe the Atomic Swap protocol (the original version on Bitcointalk~\cite{nolan2013alt}) and the American Call Option,
then point out that an Atomic Swap is equivalent to an American Call Option without the premium.





\subsection{Atomic Swap}

\subsubsection{Security assumptions}

First, we assume blockchains involved in the Atomic Swap are secure, and execute all transactions correctly.
The Atomic Swap is based on blockchains.
If the blockchains are insecure, the Atomic Swap will also be insecure.

Second, we assume the HTLC mechanism in blockchains is reliable.
More specifically,
1) blockchains produce new blocks with stable speeds;
2) the hash algorithms used by HTLCs are secure;
3) blockchains execute HTLCs correctly.

Third, the time for confirming a transaction is negligible compared to timelocks in HTLCs.
In practice, the swap initiator's timelock is 48 hours and the swap participant's timelock is 24 hours by default~\cite{nolan2013alt}, while confirming a transaction is less than 1 hour for most blockchains.

Assuming the swap initiator Alice hopes to get $x_2$ $Coin_2$ from the swap participant Bob in exchange of $x_1$ $Coin_1$. 
$Coin_1$ is the cryptocurrency on the blockchain $BC_1$, and $Coin_2$ is the cryptocurrency on the blockchain $BC_2$.
We denote the Atomic Swap as 

$$\mathcal{AS} = (x_1, Coin_1, x_2, Coin_2)$$

Let Alice be the holder of the address $\beta_{A, 1}$ on $BC_1$ and the address $\beta_{A, 2}$ on $BC_2$.
Let Bob be the holder of the address $\beta_{B, 1}$ on $BC_1$ and the address $\beta_{B, 2}$ on $BC_2$.
$\beta_{A, 1}$ holds $Coin_1$ with the amount no smaller than $x_1$, and $\beta_{B, 2}$ holds $Coin_2$ with the amount no smaller than $x_2$.

Figure~\ref{fig:sequence_diagram_original} shows the process of $\mathcal{AS}$.
In detail, $\mathcal{AS}$ consists of four stages:
\textbf{Initiate},
\textbf{Participate},
\textbf{Redeem}, and
\textbf{Refund}.


\paragraph{\textbf{Initiate}}
Alice initiates $\mathcal{AS}$ at this stage.
% s and h
First, Alice picks a random secret $s$ only known to herself, and computes the hash $h = \mathcal{H}(s)$ of $s$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is a secure hash function.
% contract
Then, Alice creates an HTLC script $\mathcal{C}_1$ that ``Alice pays $x_1$ $Coin_1$ from $\beta_{A, 1}$ to $\beta_{B, 1}$ if Bob can provide $s$ which makes $\mathcal{H}(s) = h$ before or on a timelock $\delta_1$ (which is a timestamp). After $\delta_1$, Alice can refund the money - get $x_1$ $Coin_1$ back.''
% tx
After creating $\mathcal{C}_1$, Alice publishes $\mathcal{C}_1$ as a transaction $tx_{\mathcal{C}, 1}$ on $BC_1$.
Note that $h$ is published when publishing $tx_{\mathcal{C}, 1}$.
% refund
Besides $\mathcal{C}_1$, Alice also creates a refund script $\mathcal{R}_1$ that ``Alice pays $x_1$ $Coin_1$ from $\beta_{A, 1}$ to her another address.''
This is to ensure $x_1$ $Coin_1$ can no longer be redeemed by others. Alice can publish $\mathcal{R}_1$ only after $\delta_1$.
If Bob does not redeem $x_1$ $Coin_1$ and $\delta_1$ expires, Alice can refund $x_1$ $Coin_1$ by publishing $\mathcal{R}_1$ as a transaction $tx_{\mathcal{R}, 1}$ on $BC_1$.

\paragraph{\textbf{Participate}}
Bob participates in $\mathcal{AS}$ after \textbf{Initiate}.
% contract
With the published $h$ in $tx_{\mathcal{C}, 1}$, Bob creates another HTLC script $\mathcal{C}_2$ that ``Bob pays $x_2$ $Coin_2$ from $\beta_{B, 2}$ to $\beta_{A, 2}$ if Alice can provide $s$ before or on a timelock $\delta_2$ (which is a timestamp). After the time of $\delta_2$, Bob can refund the money - get $x_2$ $Coin_2$ back.''
Here $\delta_2$ should expire before $\delta_1$.
% tx
After creating $\mathcal{C}_2$, Bob publishes $\mathcal{C}_2$ as a transaction $tx_{\mathcal{C}, 2}$ on $BC_2$.
Note that Alice knows $s$ so she can redeem $x_2$ $Coin_2$ in $tx_{\mathcal{C}, 2}$ anytime before $\delta_2$,
but Bob cannot redeem $x_1$ $Coin_1$ in $tx_{\mathcal{C}, 1}$ because he does not know $s$.
% refund 
Besides $\mathcal{C}_2$, Bob also creates a refund script $\mathcal{R}_2$ that ``Bob pays $x_2$ $Coin_2$ from $\beta_{B, 2}$ to his another address.''
This is to ensure $x_2$ $Coin_2$ can no longer be redeemed by Alice. Bob can do this only after $\delta_2$.
If Alice does not redeem $x_2$ $Coin_2$ before $\delta_2$ expires, Bob can refund $x_2$ $Coin_2$ by publishing $\mathcal{R}_2$ as a transaction $tx_{\mathcal{R}, 2}$ on $BC_2$.

\paragraph{\textbf{Redeem} or \textbf{Refund}}
At this stage, Alice can choose either to redeem $x_2$ $Coin_2$ or refund $x_1$ $Coin_1$.
Note that both \textbf{Redeem} and \textbf{Refund} are atomic:
if Alice chooses to redeem $x_2$ $Coin_2$, Bob can also redeem $x_1$ $Coin_1$;
if Alice chooses to refund $x_1$ $Coin_1$, Bob can also refund $x_2$ $Coin_2$.

\textbf{Redeem.}
Alice redeems $x_2$ $Coin_2$ by publishing $s$, then Bob can also redeem $x_1$ $Coin_1$ with the published $s$.
First, Alice provides $s$ to $tx_{\mathcal{C}, 2}$ in order to redeem $x_2$ $Coin_2$ in $tx_{\mathcal{C}, 2}$.
As a result, Alice redeems $x_2$ $Coin_2$, but exposes $s$ to Bob.
After that, Bob provides $s$ to $tx_{\mathcal{C}, 1}$ in order to redeem $x_1$ $Coin_1$ in $tx_{\mathcal{C}, 1}$.
In this way, Alice and Bob successfully exchanges $x_1$ $Coin_1$ and $x_2$ $Coin_2$.

\textbf{Refund.}
If Alice does not redeem $x_2$ $Coin_2$ after $\delta_2$ expires, Bob can refund his $x_2$ $Coin_2$ by publishing $tx_{\mathcal{R}, 2}$.
As a result, Alice cannot redeem $x_2$ $Coin_2$, and will not publish $s$.
After $\delta_1$, Alice can also refund her $x_1$ $Coin_1$ by publishing $tx_{\mathcal{R}, 1}$.


\paragraph{Atomicity analysis}
% why atomic
We can see that $\mathcal{AS}$ either succeeds or fails for both Alice and Bob.
In detail,

\begin{itemize}
    \item If Alice misbehaves when triggering \textbf{Initiate}, Bob will lose nothing as he hasn't deposited $x_2$ $Coin_2$ yet.
    \item If Bob misbehaves when triggering \textbf{Participate}, Alice can choose to abort $\mathcal{AS}$ by triggering \textbf{Refund}.
    \item Alice can only choose to redeem $x_2$ $Coin_2$ by triggering \textbf{Redeem} or wait $\delta_2$ to expire.
    Once Alice triggers \textbf{Redeem}, Bob can also trigger \textbf{Redeem}.
    Once $\delta_2$ expires, Bob can trigger \textbf{Refund} to get his $x_2$ $Coin_2$ back.
\end{itemize}

% misuse
However, one may take both $x_1$ $Coin_1$ and $x_2$ $Coin_2$ if the other does not trigger \textbf{Redeem} or \textbf{Refund} on time.
For example, if Bob does not trigger \textbf{Redeem} after Alice triggers \textbf{Redeem} and $\delta_1$ expires, Alice can also refund $x_1$ $Coin_1$ by triggering \textbf{Refund}.
It is Bob to blame in this case, because he should have had enough time - at least $\delta_2 - \delta_1$ (48 - 24 = 24 hours by default) - to redeem $x_1$ $Coin_1$.
Another example is that Alice broadcasts $tx_{\mathcal{C}, 1}$ after $\delta_2$, but Bob has already triggered \textbf{Refund}.
Therefore, Bob can also redeem $x_1$ $Coin_1$ with $s$ in $tx_{\mathcal{C}, 1}$ before $\delta_1$.
Similarly, it is Alice to blame in this case, because she should have had enough time - before $\delta_2$ (24 hours by default) - to trigger \textbf{Redeem}.















\subsection{American Call Option}

The American Call Option is a contract that ``one can buy an amount of an asset with an agreed price prior to or on an agreed time in the future''. 
Here,
the agreed price is usually called the \textit{strike price};
and the contract settlement is called \textit{exercising};
the one who proposes the contract and buys the asset is called the \textit{option buyer};
the one who sells the asset is called the \textit{option seller}.

As mentioned in Section~\ref{subsec:background_option}, the option contract itself has value, called the \textit{premium}.
In an American Call Option, the option buyer should pay for the premium when the contract is agreed by both parties, and should pay for the asset when the contract is exercised.

We denote an American Call Option contract $\Pi$ as

$$\Pi = (\pi_1, \pi_2, K, A, T, C)$$

where
the option buyer Alice with $\pi_1$ hopes to buy $\pi_2$ from the option seller Bob;
$\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are Alice's currency and Bob's asset, respectively; 
$K$ is the strike price with the unit $\pi_2 / \pi_1$ - the price of $\pi_2$ measured in $\pi_1$;
$A$ is the amount of the asset $\pi_2$ that Bob wants to sell;
$T$ is the agreed strike time;
$C$ is the \textit{premium} with the unit $\pi_1$.

The process of an American Call Option is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Advertise}: Alice creates and advertises an American Call Option contract $\Pi = (\pi_1, \pi_2, K, A, T, C)$.
    \item \textbf{Contract}: If Bob thinks $\Pi$ is profitable and Alice does not abort $\Pi$, Bob will participate in $\Pi$.
    When Bob participates, Alice should pay $C$ to Bob first.
    Note that Alice does not pay for $A$ $\pi_2$ at this stage.
    Also note that Bob cannot abort $\Pi$ after participating in $\Pi$.
    \item \textbf{Exercise} or \textbf{Abort}: Alice exercises $\Pi$ - pays $AK$ $\pi_1$ to Bob - no later than $T$, and Bob gives $A$ $\pi_2$ to Alice.
    If Alice does not exercise $\Pi$ no later than $T$, $\Pi$ will abort - Alice gets $\pi_1$ back and Bob gets $\pi_2$ back.
    In other words, both of them get their underlying asset back, but Alice loses the premium $C$ to Bob when \textbf{Contract}.
\end{enumerate}












\subsection{An Atomic Swap is a premium-free American Call Option}

We show that an Atomic Swap is equivalent to a premium-free American Call Option.
More specifically, $\mathcal{AS} = (x_1, Coin_1, x_2, Coin_2)$ is equivalent to the American Call Option contract

$$
\Pi = (Coin_1, Coin_2, \frac{x_2}{x_1}, x_2, \delta_2, 0)
$$

where:
\textbf{Advertise} in the American Call Option is equivalent to \textbf{Initiate} in the Atomic Swap;
\textbf{Contract} in the American Call Option is equivalent to \textbf{Participate} in the Atomic Swap;
\textbf{Exercise} in the American Call Option is equivalent to \textbf{Redeem} in the Atomic Swap;
\textbf{Abort} in the American Call Option is equivalent to \textbf{Refund} in the Atomic Swap.

% coin and asset
In the American Call Option context, the option buyer Alice wants to buy $x_2$ $Coin_2$ from the option seller Bob by using $x_1$ $Coin_1$.
$Coin_1$ is the currency Alice uses, $Coin_2$ is the asset Bob has.
This is equivalent to that Alice with $\pi_1$ wants to buy $\pi_2$ from Bob.
% timelock
$\delta_2$ is the timelock of the contract transaction on $BC_2$, which is equivalent to the strike time $T$ in $\Pi$. 
In $\mathcal{AS}$ Bob can refund his asset back after $\delta_2$ to abort $\mathcal{AS}$, while $\Pi$ will be automatically aborted after the strike time $T$.
% premium
Establishing $\mathcal{AS}$ does not require Alice to pay anything other than $x_1$ $Coin_1$ to Bob, which is equivalent to $\Pi$ with $C = 0$.

Note that both the Atomic Swap and the American Call Option are ``speculative'':
both the cryptocurrency exchange rates in Atomic Swaps and asset prices in the American Call Options are fluctuating overtime.
Therefore, the ``premium-free'' property enables Alice to speculate without any risk:
if Bob's asset price rises right before the strike time, she will proceed the swap to profit,
otherwise she will abort the swap to avoid the loss.
Therefore, without the premium, Alice is risk-free towards the market.
